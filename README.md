# AG Assignment

***Important:***
The `/init` endpoint needs to be called before using the application.
After running both the backend and the Blazor app, browse to `http://localhost:5257/init` before using the upload feature

There are many important features missing. Just to enumerate a few:

1. Authentication and authorization
2. Automated tests
3. Data grid features such as filtering
4. Duplicate entry detection
5. Global exception handling


Thank you for your attention
